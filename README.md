<h1>🌷 Hi, I’m Vireya Akane</h1>
<p>
My real name is <strong>Mancini Putra</strong>, but online I prefer to be known as <strong>Vireya Akane</strong> (ヴィレヤ・アカネ). 




For business or formal work, you can simply call me <strong>Mancini</strong>.
</p>
<p>
I create websites and small digital worlds quietly, at my own pace. Most of my projects are open-source, little fragments of myself waiting for the right time to be seen.
</p>
<p>
I love making <strong>website templates</strong>. If you ever use one, please leave a little <strong>star ⭐</strong>, it really makes me smile.




<em>ありがとう... thank you so much &lt;3</em>

🎀 Web Templates: I make soft and simple layouts.

🤖 Discord Bots: Sometimes I build paid custom bots.

🏘️ Local Support: I help small local businesses (UMKM) grow online as a dev/sysadmin, often for free.

🎓 Learning: Currently studying Software Engineering. It wasn’t my first choice, but I’m finding meaning in it.

🎨 Philosophy: I enjoy mixing art and logic, learning quietly through mistakes and small joys.

<h2>☁️ The Quiet Truth</h2>
</div>

"I believe femininity is strength. Softness is courage in disguise."

I’m 19 y/o, very introverted, and often shy.





I’m a femboy, preparing for a non-operative transition, step by step. People might call me genderfluid, but for me, it’s about unlocking the side of me that’s been hidden for years.

<details>
<summary><strong>🌸 Read more about my journey</strong></summary>





I’ve been in <strong>social transition</strong> for about three years now. It’s not always smooth, but I’m trying. I’m managing my weight and diet, though sometimes burnout hits and I need to rest. 






Sometimes, I have to blend in with the world outside and act like a boy, but when I’m home, I let myself breathe in soft colors. Some parts of me are hidden not because of shame, but to stay safe while still blooming.
