# 🌷 Vireya Akane (ヴィレヤ・アカネ)

> *"Soft doesn’t mean weak. Code can bloom beautifully too."* 🌸  

Hi... I’m **Vireya Akane**, 19 y/o.  
My real name is **Mancini Putra**, but online I prefer to be known as **Vireya Akane**.  
For business or formal work, you can simply call me **Mancini**.  

I create websites and small digital worlds quietly, at my own pace.  
Most of my projects are open-source, but some stay private or unuploaded.  
They’re little fragments of myself, waiting for the right time to be seen.  

I love making **website templates**, sometimes free, sometimes premium.  
If you ever use one, please leave a little **star ⭐**, it really makes me smile.  
ありがとう... thank you so much <3

## 💻 What I Do
- I make soft and simple web templates.  
- Sometimes I build Discord bots too, but they’re paid ones.  
- I also work with small local businesses (UMKM, under 100M IDR revenue) as a developer or system admin, often helping them for free to grow online.  
- I’m currently studying **Software Engineering** in college. It wasn’t really my first choice, but I’m learning to stay and find meaning in it.  
- I enjoy mixing art and logic, and I learn quietly, through mistakes and small joys.

## ☁️ About Me
I’m 19, very introverted, and often shy.  
I’m a **femboy**, preparing for a **non-operative transition**, step by step.  
People might call me genderfluid, but for me it’s about unlocking the side of me that’s been hidden for years.  
This is my choice, my voice, my quiet truth.  

I’ve been in **social transition** for about three years now.  
It’s not always smooth, but I’m trying.  
I’m still managing my weight and keeping my diet steady,  
though sometimes I hit burnout and need to rest for a while.  
It’s okay. Healing takes time, and I’m learning to be gentle with myself.  

Sometimes, I have to blend in with the world outside and act like a boy,  
but when I’m home, I let myself breathe in soft colors and peace.  
Some parts of me are hidden, not because I’m ashamed,  
but because I want to stay safe while still blooming.  

I believe femininity is strength.  
Softness is courage in disguise.  
Even if the world feels dystopian, I still want to create small beautiful things.

## 💖 Support
If my work ever makes your day a little brighter,  
a simple **star** or kind message already means a lot.  
I’ll keep making things, softly, quietly, with care.
